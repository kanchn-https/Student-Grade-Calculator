# ðŸŽ“ Student Grade Calculator System (C Language)

The **Student Grade Calculator System** is a console-based application developed in C to automate student result processing. It allows users to input marks for multiple students across different subjects, calculates the **total** and **percentage**, assigns a **grade**, and displays a formatted report.

The system uses **file handling** to store student records, enabling future retrieval and review. Each studentâ€™s name, roll number, subject marks, total, percentage, and grade are saved to a file. Users can choose to enter new records or view previously saved data during runtime.

This project is a great learning resource for beginners to practice:
- Input/output operations
- Conditional statements
- Loops and modular logic
- File handling in C
